# PHP Motors App Overview

PHP Motors App is the web app solution for the fictional PHP Motors company. PHP Motors Company wanted an app that would display their cars in stock, data, price and other information to their customers. They wanted to have a way to view their cars based on the type, and they also wanted their users to comment and show their insights to other users. With this problem on mind PHP Motors App was created.

This app is build using PHP as my backend language following the MVC architecture model. To solve the issues of our fictional customer we implemented several features to handle the problematic. Accounts, reviews and vehicles features are implemented, also a special feature to upload files when the master user creates a new vehicle is implemented. Due to the nature of our task, a relational database was implemented to perform CRUD operations and with this sanitization of data, authentication process, hashing of passwords and error handling. 

We used several PHP templates with some JS and CSS to provide a friendly UX and a nice UI, these are some demo videos on my app and the link to the app deployed on Heroku:
